      them in half, just roll out each piece into a 12 x 15 rectangle.)</p>\r\n<p>Peel

      the center, gently pleating the dough. Brush the edges with egg wash. then dot
      each tart with small pieces of butter. Return the tarts back to the refrigerator.

      to medium-low and add <em>1 cup</em> of the broth. Continue beating for another
      minute or so, until a 1/2 teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold
      water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light). Beat
      in enough of the <em>remaining 1/2 cup</em> of broth to give the mixture the
      consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon.
      Taste the batter and season with additional salt if you think it needs some.
      For the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so,
      then rebeat, adding a little more broth or water to bring the mixture to the
      soft consistency it had before.</li><li><strong>Set up the steamer.</strong>
      Steaming 26 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable
      steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. To steam them all at once, you need
      something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico or Asian stack
      steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard
      cups in a large kettle. It is best to line the rack or upper part of the steamer
      with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with the
      steam and to add more flavor. Make sure to leave tiny spaces between the husks
      so condensing steam can drain off.</li><li><strong>Form the tamales.</strong>
      Cut twenty-six 8- to 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. One
      at a time, form the tamales: Lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering
      end toward you. Spread about 1/4 cup of the batter into about a 4-inch square,
      leaving at least a 1 1/2-inch border on the side toward you and a 3/4-inch border
      along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Spoon
      about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling down the center of the batter. Pick up
      the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause
      the batter to surround the filling). If the uncovered borders of the two long
      sides you&#8217;re holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if wide,
      roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk is small,
      you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.) Finally,
      fold up the empty 1 1/2-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed &#8220;bottom&#8221;
      leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strings
      or strips of husk around the tamal. As they&#8217;re made, stand the tamales
      on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. Don&#8217;t tie the tamales
      too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. They need room to expand.</li><li><strong>Steam
      and serve the tamales.</strong> When all the tamales are in the steamer, cover
      them with a layer of leftover cornhusks; if your husk-wrapped tamales don&#8217;t
      take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum
      foil (to keep the tamales from falling over). Set the lid in place and steam
      over a constant medium heat for about 1 1/4 hours. Watch carefully that all
      the water doesn&#8217;t boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling
      water into the pot when more is necessary. Tamales are done when the husk peels
      away from the masa easily. Let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for
      a few minutes to firm up. For the best textured tamales, let them cool completely,
      then re-steam about 15 minutes to heat through.</li></ol></p>', name: Basic

      the centerpiece of an elegant dinner party.&nbsp; This recipe is actually a
      lot easier than it looks, since you can prepare both the guajillo sauce and
      the mushroom and swiss chard stuffing several days in advance.&nbsp; Bring both
      back to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe. &nbsp;</p>', instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Make
      the guajillo sauce. </strong> Set a heavy ungreased skillet or griddle over
      medium heat. Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast, until
      soft and blackened in a few spots, about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the
      papery skins and roughly chop.\r\n<p>While the garlic is roasting, break off
      the stems of the chiles, open them up, remove the seeds, then tear them into
      flat pieces. Toast the chiles a few at a time on a medium-hot skillet or griddle.
      Lay them skin-side up, press flat with a metal spatula until they are aromatic
      and lightened in color underneath &ndash; about 10 seconds per side. (If you
      see more than a whiff of smoke, they are burning.) Transfer the toasted chiles
      to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly
      to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard.</p>\r\n<p>Transfer
      the drained chiles into a food processor or blender along with the garlic, oregano,
      black pepper and cumin. Measure in 2/3 cup of the broth and process to a smooth
      puree, scraping down the sides as necessary. If you&rsquo;re using a blender
      and the mixture won&rsquo;t move through the blades, add more broth a little
      at a time until everything is moving. With a rubber spatula, work the puree
      through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl; discard the skins and seeds that
      remain in the strainer.</p>\r\n<p>Heat the oil in a medium-size (4-quart) dutch
      oven over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply,
      add it all at once. Cook, stirring constantly, as the puree sears, reduces and
      darkens to an attractively earthy brick-red paste (usually about 7 minutes).
      You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s cooked enough when it has lost that harsh raw-chile
      taste.</p>\r\n<p>Stir in the remaining 3 cups of the broth, partially cover
      and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. If the sauce has thickened
      past the consistency of a light cream soup, add more broth. Taste and season
      with about 1 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar--salt to brighten and focus
      the flavors, sugar to smooth any rough or bitter chile edges. Cover and set
      aside.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Make the mushroom and swiss chard stuffing.
      </strong> Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) non-stick skillet over medium-high
      heat. When hot, add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes
      until golden brown. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
      Add the chard and stir until wilted and dry about 5 minutes more. Remove from
      the heat and stir in 1/2 cup guajillo sauce. Cool to room temperature.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Roast
      the tenderloin. </strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butterfly the tenderloin.
      Sprinkle with salt. Spread the cooled mushroom mixture over the surface leaving
      about 1/2-inch border around all sides. Roll up, as tightly as possible, and
      using kitchen string, tie every 1 1/2-inches, then tie once lengthwise. Push
      any stuffing that has fallen out back in. Rub the entire surface with olive
      oil and sprinkle with salt. Place on a rack, set over a rimmed baking sheet
      and roast for 30 to 40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 125
      degrees for medium-rare. Remove from the oven, loosely cover with foil and let
      rest for 10 minutes before serving. While the meat is resting, warm the guajillo
      sauce.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Serve.</strong> Remove the kitchen strings

      times a year, I get the chance to enjoy this rustic, satisfying dish regularly
      where it is most well known.&nbsp; And I must say I really love fresh tortillas
      awash in the rich texture of black bean sauce, especially the Oaxacan one that
      is simmered with anisey avocado leaves (I suggest a bit of fresh fennel to substitute
      for the less-available avocado leaves; they&rsquo;re not the same, but the fennel
      moves the flavor in the Oaxacan direction).A plate of enfrijoladas with a big
      salad and cold beer or fruity red wine is a delicious lunch or supper.&nbsp;If
      you have 2 1/2 to 3 cups of beans cooked (or 3 cups of leftover Oaxacan Black
      Bean Soup), the dish is fast as well.&nbsp; And it is nutritious (low in meat
      and fat, high in grains, beans and flavor&mdash;covering most of the popular
      topics these days). So enfrijoladas are a great candidate for everyday eating.Recipe
      from Season 4, Mexico&mdash;One Plate at a Time</p>', instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Make
      black bean sauce. </strong>Place the beans in a medium-size (2- to 3-quart)
      saucepan, cover with 3 cups water, remove any beans that float and heat slowly
      to a simmer.<br />If using avocado leaves, toast them for a few seconds per
      side (they&rsquo;ll become aromatic and lightly brown) over a medium gas flame
      or heated griddle. Add the avocado leaves (or fennel), <em>1/4 cup </em>of the
      chorizo and <em>1/2 </em>of the onion to the beans, partially cover and simmer
      over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are fully
      tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If you see the beans peeking up through the liquid,
      add water to cover them by 1/2-inch.<br />Coarsely puree the beans in batches
      in a food processor or <em>loosely</em> covered blender. Return to the pot and
      add enough water to thin to the consistency of a medium cream soup. Taste and
      season with salt.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The tortillas and chorizo. </strong>Set
      up a steamer (a vegetable steamer in a large saucepan filled with 1/2 inch of
      water works well); heat to a boil. Wrap the tortillas in a heavy kitchen towel,
      lay in the steamer and cover with a tight lid. Boil 1 minute, turn off the heat
      and let stand without opening the steamer for 15 minutes.<br />Meanwhile, in
      a small (7- to 8-inch) skillet, cook the remaining <em>1 cup </em>of chorizo
      over medium-low heat until done, about 10 minutes, breaking up any clumps as
      it cooks. Drain off the rendered fat, cover the skillet and keep warm over very
      low heat.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Finish the enfrijoladas. </strong>Turn the oven
      on to the lowest setting and warm a serving platter in it. Pour out 1 1/2 cups
      of the warm bean sauce onto a deep plate. One by one, dip both sides of the
      warm tortillas into the sauce, fold into quarters and transfer to the warm serving
      platter, laying the tortillas in 2 rows, slightly overlapping. Keep warm in
      the oven.<br />Scrape any bean sauce remaining on the plate back into the pot.
      (If the sauce has thickened, add a little water to get it back to the original
      consistency.) Quickly bring it to a simmer, spoon it over the folded tortillas
      (there should be a considerable amount of sauce), strew with the warm chorizo<em>,</em>
      splash with the optional salsa, then sprinkle on the crumbled cheese, chopped
      parsley and the remaining sliced onion. Serve your delicious <em>enfrijoladas</em>
      without hesitation--they don&rsquo;t take well to delays.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Advance
      Preparation: </strong>The black beans can be prepared through Step 1 several
      days ahead; the chorizo can be cooked, too. Store separately in the refrigerator,
      covered. Reheat the sauce slowly in a covered pan, thinning if necessary. Warm
      the chorizobefore heating the tortillas and finishing the dish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shortcuts:
      </strong> Though the flavor and color won&rsquo;t be as nice, the beans could
      be replaced with 2 drained 15-ounce cans of black beans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Variations
      and Improvisation:</strong> The avocado leaf (or fennel) could easily be omitted
      or replaced with 2 or 3 canned chipotles <em>en adobo</em> or toasted-and-soaked
      red-black chipotles or <em>chiles pasillas oaxaquenos </em>(in fact, with the
      chipotle or <em>pasilla oaxaqueno </em>you won&rsquo;t really miss the chorizo--either
      in the beans or on the top)<em>. </em>Spooning soft goat cheese onto the tortillas
      before folding them makes the dish more substantial (you can omit the cheese
      garnish, if you wish). Bacon, ham or other sausage can replace chorizo; <em>enfrijoladas</em>
      are also delicious splashed with Roasted Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa. In short,
      with bean sauce and tortillas as a base, you can vary toppings (or fillings)
      as you like.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Plantain <em>Enfrijoladas </em>with Sour Cream<em>:</em>
      </strong>Prepare the bean sauce, tortillas and chorizo as described in Steps
      1 and 2. Fry 1 diced ripe plantain in a little vegetable oil over medium heat
      until browned. Dip the warmed tortillas in the warm sauce as described in Step
      3, filling them with a mixture of the fresh cheese and chorizoas they are folded
      into quarters and layed in an ovenproof baking dish. Sauce them, then bake them
      covered in a 400 degree oven for 5 minutes or so, until very hot, then drizzle
      with a little crema or sour cream thinned with a little milk. Garnish with the
      fried plantains, onion and parsley.</p>", name: Black Bean Bathed Enchiladas

      saute the white onion until richly browned, about 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon
      to remove the onion to a small bowl, leaving as much of the fat behind as possible.
      You're now ready to start assembling your packages.</p>\r\n<p>Cut eight 17 x
      18-inch pieces of aluminum foil. Set aside. Unfold the banana leaves, cut eight
      &ndash; 17-inch pieces choosing sections of the largest relatively unbroken
      leaves. Trim off the thin hard strip of the side of all the pieces. To make
      the pieces pliable, either steam them for 20 minutes or pass each one briefly
      over an open flame until it turns from dull and stiff to soft and shiny. Assemble
      the chicken packages as follows. One piece of foil, one piece of banana leaf,
      3 to 4 slices of sweet potatoes, 2 to 3 pieces plantain, one piece of chicken,
      followed by a portion of the onions, and 4 to 5 strips of chipotles. Gather
      up the foil to create a boat shape, then drizzle 1/4 cup of the chicken broth
      mixture over the top. Wrap the banana leaf to completely cover the chicken,
      then fold the two long ends of the foil together to seal the top. Finally, fold
      up each end to create a sealed package. Transfer the chicken packages to 2 rimmed
      baking sheets and place in the oven. One sheet on the top rack and one on the
      lower rack. After 20 minutes, switch the baking sheets. Bake for an additional
      25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</p>\r\n<p>Carefully open
      the foil packages and using a metal spatula, transfer the banana leaf package

    instructions: "<p>In a small ungreased skillet, roast the unpeeled garlic and
      the chiles over medium heat, turning occasionally, until both are soft and blotchy
      black in places - 5 to 10 minutes for the chiles, 10 to 15 minutes for the garlic.
      Cool, then peel the garlic. Place both garlic and chiles in a food processor
      along with the lime juice and oil. Run the machine until the mixture is as smoothly
      pureed as possible. Season highly with salt, usually about 1 1/2 teaspoons.</p>\r\n<p>Smear
      the mixture over both sides of the steaks, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</p>\r\n<p>Light
      a charcoal fire and let the coals burn until they are covered with gray ash;
      position the grill grate and let it heat for a couple of minutes. Spray or brush
      the steaks on both sides with a little oil. Lay on the grill grates and let
      cook for 3 or 4 minutes, until the grates have nicely seared beautiful grill
      marks into the meat - don't attempt to move the steaks until you can see nice
      grill marks. Flip the steaks and cook until as done as you like (typically about
      2 to 3 minutes longer for medium rare). I like to let the steaks rest for a
      few minutes (on a cool part of the grill, a grate suspended over the back of
      the grill or a very low oven) before serving to allow the meat to reabsorb all
      the juices. Serve with <a>Lazy Salsa</a> or another salsa or hot sauce of your
      liking.</p>", name: '&#8220;Brava&#8221; Steak'}

    instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare the</strong> <strong>tart shell. </strong>
      Butter and flour a 9 1/2 or 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. In a large
      bowl, combine the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt. Scrape in the butter, and
      using your hands, mix the pieces of butter into the flour until the mixture
      looks like coarse crumbs. Drizzle in 3 tablespoons very cold water and work
      the mixture until it comes together into a ball. Add an additional tablespoon
      of water if the dough is dry and crumbly (it should hold together when you press
      it between you fingertips). Gather the dough together, place it onto a large
      sheet of plastic wrap and cover with another sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten
      it into a round disc and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough 2 inches larger
      than the tart pan. (It may have some cracks, but it patches easily.) Remove
      the top sheet of plastic wrap. Using the bottom sheet of plastic wrap, turn
      over the dough into the tart pan and peel off the final piece of plastic wrap.
      Pat the dough evenly over the bottom and sides. Prick the dough all over with
      a fork, making certain to prick the sides as well as the bottom. Chill in the
      refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bake the tart shell.
      </strong> Heat the oven to 425 degrees and place a rack the middle of the oven.
      Place the chilled tart crust on a rimmed baking sheet and slide into the hot
      oven. Bake for 20 minutes or until the edges are slightly brown and the bottom
      no longer looks moist.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare the tomatillo filling.</strong>
      In a small bowl, stir together the tapioca flour with 1/3 cup water. In a large
      bowl, combine the sliced tomatillos, sugar, a pinch of salt, orange zest and
      1/4 cup of the pecans. Pour the flour mixture over the tomatillos and stir to
      combine. Scoop into the baked crust and gently spread all the way to the sides
      in an even layer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bake the tomatillo tart. </strong>Place
      in the oven and bake until the filling has set, about 45 minutes. (There will
      be a little movement in the very center of the tart which will finish setting
      up as it cools.) Remove the tart from the oven and sprinkle the remaining 1/4

      chicken is a real time saver and works as a great base for many main-course
      dishes.&nbsp; I love the flavors of tomatillo and chicken, so the sauce is an
      easy white sauce that I''ve kicked up by adding roasted tomatillos, serranos,
      and garlic.&nbsp; For the vegetables I''m using frozen corn and spinach, along

      prepare both the filling and the pastry the night before.&nbsp; The next night,
      all you have to do is preheating the oven, brush egg wash over the pastry, and

      Keep an eye on the garlic and serranos since they'll take less time to roast
      and you'll need to remove them sooner. Scrape the tomatillos along with their
      juices into a blender or food processor. Add the peeled garlic and serranos,

      the onions are golden brown. Stir in the sliced mushrooms, continue cooking
      for an additional 5 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and most of
      their liquid has evaporated. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter. Once
      it's melted, stir in flour and continue stirring for 2 minutes to cook the flour.

      butter and jelly so when I tried to think about the perfect dessert for this
      special occasion, I knew it had to involve chocolate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve used
      ancho chiles here, not for their chile kick, but how they add an interesting
      dimension to the chocolate.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be scared off by the amount of
      ancho chile puree I&rsquo;ve used, I&rsquo;ve given you a range so you can decide
      how spicy you&rsquo;d like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve chosen to use sheet or
      leaf gelatin for this recipe because it&rsquo;s actually easier to use since
      it dissolves easier than the powdered type.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t find it
      or don&rsquo;t have time to order it on line, I&rsquo;ve given the proportions
      for powdered in the Testing Notes.&nbsp; This recipe is too good to limit it
      to Valentine&rsquo;s Day and can be made several days in advance.</p>', instructions: "<p>Stem
      and seed the ancho chiles . Toast them on a dry skillet over medium, pressing
      them flat against the hot surface for about 10 seconds with a metal spatula
      until they are aromatic and have lightened in color a little on the inside;
      flip and toast the other side. Place the chiles in a bowl, cover with hot water,
      weight with a plate to keep them submerged and let rehydrate 20 minutes. Drain
      and discard the water. Transfer the softened chiles to a blender or food processor
      and add 2/3 cup water. Process to a smooth puree. Scrape through a medium sieve
      to catch any skins or seeds. Measure out 1/4 to 1/3 cup, depending on how spicy
      you want the mousse and scrape it into a medium bowl. Transfer the remaining
      chile puree into a jar, seal with a lid and place it in the refrigerator. It&rsquo;ll
      last for up to 3 months.</p>\r\n<p>Using a vegetable peeler, shave some chocolate
      from the bar to use as a garnish (about 1/2 ounce), then chop the remaining
      (5 1/2 ounces) chocolate and scrape the chopped chocolate into the bowl with
      the ancho puree. Sift the cocoa into the bowl.</p>\r\n<p>Soak the gelatin in
      cold water for a few minutes until it blooms (softens). (If you&rsquo;re using
      powdered gelatin see the testing notes below.) Squeeze out the water from the
      gelatin sheets and discard the water. Heat the Kahlua in a small microwave safe
      bowl for about 30 seconds until it&rsquo;s hot. Add the bloomed gelatin and
      stir until it&rsquo;s completely dissolved, then add the vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon
      salt.</p>\r\n<p>Measure 1/2 cup heavy cream into a small saucepan and bring
      to a brisk simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chile mixture and stir
      until all the chocolate has melted, then stir in the Kahlua/gelatin mixture.</p>\r\n<p>Pour
      1 1/2 cups heavy cream into a mixing bowl and whip to medium peaks. Scoop into
      the bowl with the chocolate base and gently fold to combine. Spoon into 4 decorative
      stemmed glasses. Place the glasses in the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours
      before serving. Cover the glasses with plastic wrap if you&rsquo;re planning
      on leaving them in the refrigerator for more than 2 hours. Just before you&rsquo;re
      ready to serve, whip the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream and spoon a dollop on
      each serving. Sprinkle on the chocolate shavings, then it&rsquo;s time to dig
      in.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Testing Notes:</strong> If you&rsquo;re unable to get
      sheet gelatin, you can use powdered gelatin instead. In a small bowl, mix together
      the Kahlua and vanilla. Sprinkle 1 1/4 teaspoons of powdered gelatin and stir
      to combine. Let it sit for 10 minutes until the gelatin blooms and all the liquid
      has been absorbed. Heat the cream, but before you pour it over the chocolate
      chile mixture, stir in the gelatin and make sure that it completely dissolves
      before you add it to the chocolate. From that point, you&rsquo;re back to following
      the original recipe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jill's Wine Recommendations:</strong>
      I suggest an LBV port. The Warre&rsquo;s LBV brings out the fruitiness of the
      Ancho chile. If you like a drier style port, I suggest the Quinta do Noval LBV
      which brings out more of the dark chocolate flavor. It&rsquo;s a great way to
      end a romantic Valentine&rsquo;s meal.</p>", name: Chocolate Chile Mousse}

    instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare the cornhusks.</strong> Cover the husks
      with very hot water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand
      for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable.<br />For forming the tamales,
      separate out 24 of the largest and most pliable husks&mdash;ones that are at
      least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. If you can&rsquo;t
      find enough good ones, overlap some of the large ones to give wide, sturdy surfaces
      to spread the batter on. Pat the chosen husks dry with a towel.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare
      the batter.</strong> Roughly chop the Mexican chocolate, then pulverize it in
      a food processor. You should have 1 1/2 cups. With an electric mixer on medium-high
      speed, beat the butter, lard and/or shortening with the Mexican chocolate, sugar,
      salt and baking powder until light and fluffy in texture, about 3 minutes. Continue
      beating as you add the masa (fresh or reconstituted) in three additions. Reduce
      the speed to medium-low, then add the milk or water. Continue beating for another
      minute or so, until 1/2 teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold
      water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light).<br
      />Beat in a little additional milk or water if needed to give the mixture the
      consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon.<br
      />For the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so,
      then rebeat, adding enough additional milk or water to bring the mixture to
      the soft consistency it had before.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Set up the steamer.</strong>
      Steaming 24 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable
      steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. To steam them all at once, you need
      something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico or Asian stack
      steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard
      cups in a large kettle.<br />It is best to line the rack or upper part of the
      steamer with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with
      the steam and to add more flavor. Make sure to leave tiny spaces between the
      husks so condensing steam can drain off.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Form the tamales.</strong>
      Cut twenty-four 8 or 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. One
      at a time, form the tamales: Lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering
      end toward you. Spread about 1/4 cup of the batter into a 4-inch square, leaving
      at least a 1 1/2-inch border on the side toward you and a 3/4-inch border along
      the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Sprinkle
      a few raisins or chocolate pieces (if using) down the center of the batter.
      Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will
      cause the batter to surround the raisins). If the uncovered borders of the two
      long sides you&rsquo;re holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if
      wide, then roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk
      is small, you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.)
      Finally, fold up the empty 1 1/2-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly
      closed \"bottom,\" leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely
      tying one of the strings or strips of husk around the tamal.<br />As they&rsquo;re
      made, stand the tamales on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. Don&rsquo;t
      tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. They need
      room to expand.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Steam and serve the tamales.</strong> When
      all the tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover cornhusks;
      if your husk-wrapped tamales don&rsquo;t take up the entire steamer, fill in
      the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from
      falling down). Set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for
      about 1 1/4 hours. Watch carefully that all the water doesn&rsquo;t boil away
      and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is
      necessary.<br />Tamales are done when the husk peels away from the masa easily.
      Let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for a few minutes to firm up.
      For the best textured tamales, let them cool completely, then re-steam about
      15 minutes to heat through.<br />Serve tamales opened up on a plate with a sprinkling
      of fresh berries, a spoonful or two of custard sauce and garnished with mint
      sprigs.<strong>Working Ahead: </strong>Both filling and batter can be made several
      days ahead, as can the finished tamales; refrigerate, well cover. Re-steam (or
      even microwave) tamales before serving. For even more flexibility, batter, filling
      or finished tamales can be frozen. Defrost finished tamales in the refrigerator
      overnight before re-steaming.</li>\r\n</ol>", name: Chocolate Tamales}

      melts at body temperature, a pair of latex gloves keeps the chocolate from melting
      as quickly from the heat of your hands. They also make clean up quick and easy.</p>",

      let it burn until the coals are covered with gray ash, but the fire is still
      quite hot; for the smokiest flavor, throw on a few soaked wood chips just before
      beginning to grill. Lay the tomatoes, habanero chiles and 1 head of unpeeled
      garlic on the grill (it's easiest to use a perforated grilling pan, so nothing
      sticks or falls through the grates) and cook, turning regularly, until everything
      is soft, blackened and blistered, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>In a blender or
      food processor, blend the olive oil with 2 cloves of peeled garlic, 2/3 cup
      of the chopped cilantro and 1 teaspoon salt. Smear it over both sides of the
      salmon. Lay the salmon on the hottest part of the grill. When it is marked underneath,
      flip the pieces and mark them on the other side - the salmon should still be
      rare. Remove to a cooling rack set over a plate.</p>\r\n<p>Turn the oven on
      to 375 degrees. When handleable, peel the grilled tomatoes and garlic; discard
      the peels. In a blender or food processor (in batches if necessary), blend the
      tomatoes, garlic and habaneros to a coarse puree. You should have a little over
      4 cups of puree. Stir in enough water to bring the quantity to 6 cups. Taste
      and season with salt, usually about a scant 2 teaspoons. Remove 1 cup of the
      salsa and set aside.</p>\r\n<p>Mix the ricotta, half of the crema, eggs and
      remaining cilantro. Spoon 1/4 of the sauce over the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch
      baking pan. Arrange 4 of the pasta sheets over the sauce (it's okay if they
      slightly overlap; because they expand, they won't completely cover the sauce).
      Next, spoon on another 1/4 of the sauce, then 1/2 of the ricotta. Make another
      layer using 4 pasta sheets, another 1/4 of the sauce and the remaining ricotta.

      350&deg;. Measure the broth into a large (4-quart) saucepan. Add 1 tablespoon
      of salt , if you are using salted broth, 2 tablespoons if you&rsquo;re using

      (but not smoking), add the plantains and fry, breaking apart any clumps until
      the plantains are a rich golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Use a slotted spoon
      or wire skimmer to remove the plantain cubes to paper towels to drain.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fry
      the rice.</strong> Set up a large strainer over a metal bowl; set beside the
      stove on a heat-resistant surface. With the pan of oil still over the heat,
      raise the heat to high and add the rice. Stir regularly until the rice has turned
      from translucent to milky white (but not begun to brown), about 10 minutes.
      Immediately (and carefully) pour the rice and oil into the strainer, making
      sure to get all the rice out of the pan. Clean off any drips on the outside
      of the pan.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cook the rice.</strong> Without washing the
      pan, set it over medium heat. If there isn&rsquo;t a generous coating of oil
      on the bottom, spoon a little of the strained oil back into the pot. Add the
      onion and cook, stirring regularly, until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes.

      through all parts of the pan, making sure to scrape down any rice grains that
      are clinging to the sides above the liquid. Cover and place in the oven. After
      30 minutes uncover and test a grain of rice: if it&rsquo;s still a little chalky

    instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Make the broth base and filling.</strong>
      In a medium-large (4-quart) saucepan, heat the lard or oil over medium. Add
      the onions and cook, stirring regularly, until they are very well browned, about
      10 minutes. While the onions are cooking, puree the undrained canned tomatoes
      (if using fresh tomatoes, puree them with 2/3 cup water), using a blender or
      food processor and working in two batches if necessary for your equipment. When
      the onions are well browned, raise the heat to medium-high and add the pureed
      tomatoes, cinnamon and black pepper. Stir regularly as the mixture boils briskly,
      reducing until it becomes the consistency of thick tomato sauce, about 25 minutes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prepare
      the tomato broth.</strong> Remove 2 cups of the tomato mixture and set aside.
      Stir the broth into the mixture that remains. Partially cover and simmer over
      low heat for 45 minutes or so, while you&rsquo;re preparing the filling and
      chiles.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Make the pork picadillo filling.</strong> Set a
      large (12-inch) skillet (preferably non-stick) over medium high heat. Add the
      almonds and stir around until they color to a deep golden, about 2 minutes.
      Remove. Crumble the pork into the skillet and fry, stirring often, until thoroughly
      cooked (some of the edges should be browned and crispy), 10 to 15 minutes. If
      the pork has rendered a lot of fat, drain it off. Mix in the reserved 2 cups
      of tomato mixture, raisins and vinegar. Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly,
      until the mixture is very thick and homogenous, about 20 minutes. Stir in the
      almonds, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1 teaspoon. Cool.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Prepare
      the chiles.</strong> While the picadillo is cooking, pour 1-inch of oil into
      a heavy deep skillet or pot&mdash;the pot should be 12 inches wide and 3 to
      4 inches deep for easiest maneuvering of the chiles&mdash;and set over medium
      to medium high to heat to 350 degrees. (Using a thermometer is the most accurate
      way to assure the proper heat, but there are other reliable clues: The oil releases
      that &ldquo;hot oil&rdquo; aroma and its surface begins shimmering. When you
      think the oil is hot, test the edge of a chile&mdash;it should sizzle vigorously.
      Remember&mdash;smoking oil is dangerously overheated and will give the chiles
      a bad taste.) In two batches, fry the chiles, turning them continually for about
      1 minute, until they are evenly blistered (they&rsquo;ll look uniformly light
      green, having lightened as they blister). Drain on paper towels. Remove the
      oil from the heat. When the chiles are cool enough to handle, rub off the blistered
      skins, then cut an incision in the side of each one, starting 1/2- inch below
      the stem end and continuing to within 1/2- inch of the tip. One by one, work
      your finger inside the chiles and dislodge all the seeds clustered just below
      the stem. Quickly rinse the seeds from inside the chiles, being careful not
      to rip or tear the opening any wider; rinse off any stray bits of skin. Drain
      on paper towels, cut-side down.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Stuff the chiles.</strong>
      Stuff each well drained chile with about 1/2 cup of cool pork filling, then
      slightly overlap the two sides of the incision and pin them back together with
      a skewer or 2 toothpicks. For the greatest ease in battering and frying, flatten
      the chiles slightly, place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for
      about 1 hour to firm. (For notes on working with thoroughly frozen chiles, please
      read the note in Working Ahead below.)</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Batter and
      fry the chiles.</strong> Reheat the oil to 350 degrees and set up a tray lined
      with several layers of paper towels. Separate the eggs: whites into the bowl
      of an electric mixer, the yolks into another bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt
      to the whites and begin beating them on medium speed. When they are beginning
      to look dry and hold a stiff peak (but are not at all rigid), beat in the yolks
      two at a time until well incorporated. Lastly, beat in the 2 tablespoons of
      flour. Spread the 1 cup of flour on a plate. One at a time, batter the first
      four chiles: roll in the flour, shake off the excess, pick up by the stem, dip
      into the batter, pull quickly straight up out of the batter, then lay into the
      hot oil. (If your kitchen is very warm, it&rsquo;s best to hold the remaining
      batter for the second round in the refrigerator.) Once the first four are in
      the oil, begin gently, gently basting them with spoonfuls of hot oil (this will
      help set the uncooked batter on top). When they&rsquo;re richly golden underneath,
      about 4 minutes, use one small metal spatula underneath and another one (or
      a spoon) on top to gently turn the chiles over. Fry until the other side is
      richly golden, another 3 to 4 minutes. Using the metal spatula, remove the chiles
      to drain on paper towels. Repeat with the second half of the chiles.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Serve
      the chiles.</strong> Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Once all the fried chiles
      have cooled for at least 5 minutes, pick them up by carefully rolling each one
      onto one hand, then transferring to a baking sheet (lined with parchment, if
      you wish, for extra ease at the time of serving). Pull out the wooden skewer
      by twisting it gently. Bake for about 15 minutes to reheat, to render some of
      the absorbed oil and to crisp slightly. Meanwhile, bring the tomato broth to
      a boil and check the consistency: it should be similar to a brothy tomato soup.
      If too thick, thin with a little water or broth; if too thin, boil rapidly until
      thickened slightly. Season it with salt, usually about &frac12; teaspoon. Ladle
      about 1/2 cup of the broth into each of 8 deep serving bowls (large soup bowls
      or pasta bowls are perfect here). Nestle in one of the chiles, garnish with
      the herb sprigs and get ready for a taste of real Mexico.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Work
      Ahead:</strong> The beauty of this dish is the way so many steps can be done
      in advance. The brothy sauce and filling (Steps 1 through 3) can be made several
      days in advance and stored in the refrigerator, covered. The chiles may be blistered,
      peeled and seeded (Step 4) a day in advance, though if I were that far ahead,
      I&rsquo;d stuff (Step 5) and freeze them, too, just for ease in the frying.
      Battered and fried chiles will hold for an hour or two at room temperature before
      reheating them in the 400 degree oven (Step 7). (If you freeze the chiles until
      solid, be sure to complete the frying a full half hour in advance of oven-reheating
      and serving.) While reheating the chiles, warm the broth and you&rsquo;re ready
      to serve.</p>", name: Classic Pork Picadillo-Stuffed Chiles in Tomato Broth}

    instructions: "<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>The achiote marinade.</strong> Measure
      the <em>achiote</em> seeds and oregano into a spice grinder, adding the black
      pepper, cumin, cloves and cinnamon, and run the grinder until everything&rsquo;s
      as powdery as you can get it (you may need to work in batches).In a blender,
      combine the ground mixture with 1 tablespoon salt, the garlic and sour orange
      juice (or lime juice plus orange juice). Blend until smooth&mdash;there should
      be very little grittiness when a little is rubbed between your fingers.If you&rsquo;re
      working ahead, pour the mixture into a non-aluminum container, cover, refrigerate
      6 hours or longer. Before using, blend the mixture again to give it an even
      smoother texture. (The long steeping and second blending isn&rsquo;t absolutely
      essential, though without it the marinade may be a little gritty.)</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Marinating
      the meat.</strong> In a large bowl or large plastic food bag combine meat and
      marinade, turning the meat to coat it evenly. (Though achiote has tenacious
      coloring properties, I suggest you do this quickly with your hands.) For the
      greatest penetration of flavor, let the meat marinate refrigerated (covered
      if in a bowl) for several hours, or even overnight.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Slow-grilling
      the pork.</strong> Heat a gas grill to medium-high or light a charcoal fire
      and let it burn just until the coals are covered with gray ash and very hot.
      Using scissors, cut off the hard edge you&rsquo;ll find on most banana leaves
      (where the leaf attached to the central rib). Cut 3 sections of banana leaf,
      each about 1 foot longer than the length of a large roasting pan. Line the bottom
      and sides of the roasting pan with the leaves, overlapping them generously and
      letting them hang over the edges of the pan. Lay the meat in the pan, drizzle
      with all the marinade. Fold in the banana leaf edges over the meat. Cut 3 more
      sections of banana leaf slightly longer than the pan. Lay them over the top
      of the meat, again generously overlapping; tuck them in around the sides.When
      the grill is ready, either turn the burner(s) in the center to medium-low or
      bank the coals of the grill for indirect cooking. For the charcoal grill, set
      the grill grate in place. Set the pan on the grill grate and close the grill
      cover. Grill until the meat is thoroughly tender (work a fork in near the bone&mdash;the
      meat should easily come free), usually about 4 hours. If your grill has a thermometer,
      aim to keep the temperature between 300 degrees and 350 degees. To maintain
      an even temperature with charcoal, add more charcoal regularly (usually a few
      pieces every half hour or so).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Simple pickled onions.</strong>
      While the meat is cooking, prepare the onions. Scoop the onions into a non-aluminum
      bowl. Pour boiling water over them, wait 10 seconds, then pour the onions into
      a strainer. Return the drained onions to the bowl, pour on the sour orange juice
      (or the lime-orange combo) and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cover and set aside
      until serving time.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Habanero Salsa.</strong> In an
      ungreased skillet over medium heat, roast the chiles and garlic, turning regularly,
      until they&rsquo;re soft and darkened in spots, 5 to 10 minutes for the chiles,
      15 minutes for the garlic. When cool, slip the skins off the garlic.In a blender
      or small food processor, add the garlic and roasted chiles plus the lime juice
      and enough water to give it a spoonable consistency, usually 2 to 4 tablespoons.
      Blend until smooth. Taste (gingerly) and season with salt, usually about 1/2
      teaspoon. This salsa will last several days.</li>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Serving.</strong>
      Remove the top banana leaves. Tip the pan to accumulate the juices in one end
      and spoon off the fat. Season with more salt if necessary.You may want to remove
      the bones and cut the large pieces of meat into manageable serving sizes, but
      I suggest you leave everything right in the roasting pan for serving. Set out
      your <em>cochinita pibil </em>with a large fork and spoon (for spooning up all
      those juices). Drain the red onions and set out in a serving bowl to top each
      portion, along with the salsa to cautiously dab on each portion.<strong>Working
      Ahead:</strong> If you&rsquo;re the plan-ahead type, make the marinade on Day
      1, reblend it and marinate the meat on Day 2 and then slow-roast the meat for
      serving on Day 3. The marinade will hold for a week or more in the refrigerator.
      Once the pork is marinated, cook it within 24 hours. The finished dish will
      keep for a couple of days, covered and refrigerated (meat and juice only&mdash;no
      banana leaves), though the texture of the meat won&rsquo;t be quite as nice
      as fresh-from-the-oven. Warm refrigerated cooked meat slowly (a 300 degree oven)
      in the juice, covered. Pickled onions will keep for a week or so in the refrigerator,
      well covered.\r\n<p><strong>Variation:</strong> The pork can be baked in a 325
      degree oven instead of on the grill; cover the meat rather loosely with foil
      before baking.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>", name: Cochinita Pibil}

      richer than most of the buttery egg breads that are created in Oaxaca.&nbsp;
      It&rsquo;s based on a simple brioche recipe from Alice Medrich in Pure Desserts.
      &nbsp;From Season 9, Mexico&mdash;One Plate at a Time</p>', instructions: "<p>Place
      the flour in a shallow baking dish, cover, and chill in the freezer for about
      half an hour. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, beat the
      cold butter until it is creamy and smooth. Scrape the butter onto a plate and
      refrigerate; wash and dry the mixing bowl and paddle.</p>\r\n<p>In the bowl,
      combine the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar in &frac14; cup warm water until
      just dissolved. Let stand a few minutes until foamy. (If the yeast doesn&rsquo;t
      start foaming right away, it&rsquo;s not fresh; start again with fresh yeast.)
      To the yeast mixture, add the remaining sugar, 4 of the eggs, crema, salt and
      chilled flour. Mix with the paddle on low speed until the ingredients are blended.
      Replace the paddle with the dough hook, and knead the dough on medium speed
      for about 5 minutes until very elastic and smooth.</p>\r\n<p>Now, add the creamed
      butter in 4 additions, beating in each addition until thoroughly incorporated.
      Scrape the dough into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight (it can stay
      refrigerated for a full day or so).</p>\r\n<p>Scrape the dough onto a floured
      surface and press with your hands to deflate. Cut off a piece of dough that
      looks like about 1/5 of the total and set it aside. Divide the remaining dough
      into 12 even pieces. Cupping your hand over a piece of dough on an un-floured
      section of your work surface (you want the dough to have some traction on the
      surface), roll the dough in a circle while exerting slight pressure with the
      palm of your hand. Rolling the dough around about 10 times&mdash;if you&rsquo;re
      exerting the right amount of pressure&mdash;should create a tight, spherical
      ball when you release your hand. As each of the twelve pieces is rolled, place
      them on a silicon mat or parchment-lined baking sheet, evenly spaced apart.</p>\r\n<p>Divide
      the dough you set aside into 12 even pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about
      4 inches long. Cut them in half, then roll each half into 3-inch rope, pressing
      more firmly in the middle to make it thinner there. Brush each of the 12 dough
      balls with a little water to make them tacky, then drape two ropes in an X shape
      over the top to create the &ldquo;crossbones&rdquo; look. Cover the decorated
      breads with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until about double

      (5- to 6-quart) pot (preferably a Dutch oven or Mexican earthenware <em>olla</em>)
      and set over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, until
      deep golden, about 10 minutes (this gives a roasty flavor to the beans, reminiscent

      measure it into the large pot and add the onion. Scoop in the beans, measure
      in 2 quarts of water, and remove any beans that float.<br />Add the optional
      <em>epazote</em>, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer,
      partially covered, until the beans are thoroughly tender, about 2 hours (there
      should be no chalkiness at all when you break a bean open), depending on the
      type and freshness of your beans. You'll need to gently stire the beans regularly
      and add water as necessary to keep the liquid a generous&nbsp;&frac12; inch
      above the level of the beans.</li>\r\n<li><em>Finishing the beans.</em> Season

      then remove from the heat, and they're ready to serve (to serve a bowl of beans,
      there should be just enough of the slightly creamy broth to cover the beans;
